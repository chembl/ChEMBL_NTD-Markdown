# ChEMBL-NTD

Welcome to the **ChEMBL - Neglected Tropical Disease** archive, a repository for Open Access primary screening and medicinal chemistry data directed at neglected diseases - endemic tropical diseases of the developing regions of the Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The primary purpose of ChEMBL-NTD is to provide a freely accessible and permanent archive and distribution centre for deposited data. ChEMBL-NTD is a subset of the data in the free medicinal chemistry and drug discovery database [ChEMBL](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/beta/). We actively encourage download and use of the data, we have also provided some simple search and analysis tools on this site to allow exploration and querying of the data.

ChEMBL-NTD is maintained by EMBL-EBI at Hinxton in the United Kingdom, and has received no funding from any commercial organisation, individual or investor. More information on the EMBL-EBI can be found [here](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/).

The deposited data are hosted on the servers of the EMBL-EBI at Hinxton in the United Kingdom. The static pages are hosted by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

## ChEMBL-NTD Terms of Use

We encourage all users to download, copy and redistribute these data as needed. However, in the spirit of open collaboration and to enable rapid development of new therapeutics for neglected disease, we encourage following these basic principles:

* Users who annotate, add to, or modify these data in a way that adds significant value are encouraged to release their work to the public domain, ideally by re-contributing their findings to ChEMBL-NTD.
* When these data are used or cited in a paper or other scholarly work please reference the citation provided in each deposition set.

### Deposited Set 20: 2nd August 2016 - SwissTPH T. brucei screening hits

![Swiss TPH Image](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chemblntd/static/images/home/swiss_tph.png)  


Welcome to the [SwissTPH](http://www.swisstph.ch/) T. brucei screening hits dataset. The protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei spp., the causative agents of human sleeping sickness, are transmitted by tsetse flies. During differentiation from bloodstream forms to procyclic forms, which naturally occur in the midgut of the fly, the trypanosomes shed their coat of variant surface glycoprotein \(VSG\). This process would be lethal for the parasites while in the bloodstream of an infected patient. We searched in a medium-throughput screen for triggers that artificially stimulate differentiation towards procyclic forms at 37°C and identified 28 hits. The differentiation-inducing hits could facilitate studies on the regulation of differentiation and serve as lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry in order to develop new treatments for sleeping sickness.
